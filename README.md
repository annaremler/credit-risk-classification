# Module 20 Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis ffor this module is to predict whether a loan is high-risk or low-risk. As such, the tools we used were accuracy, precision, and recall which help evaluate whether the machine learning model is "working".

## Results
* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy: 0.99
  * Precision: 0.99
  * Recall scores: 0.99

* For Model 2, the results were:
  * Accuracy: 1.00
  * Precision: 1.00
  * Recall scores: 1.00
## Summary

In summary, from the limited data that was done in this module, I would recommend using the logistic regression model for credit risk assessment (though the results are very similar). The high accuracy and precision scores show that the model is effective in identifying high-risk loans, which minimizes the potential financial losses for the company.
